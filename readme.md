# M-Buttons

M-Buttons is a CSS3 SASS button library designed around modular classes and ease-of-use.

## Install

### Method 1: SASS import

This method is the most configurable as it ties directly into your existing sass workflow. Add a new import `import 'm-buttons'` at the bottom of your main sass file. This will let you reference your own sass variables for the configuration of m-buttons.

### Method 2: CSS href

Either use the existing `m-buttons.css` file or compile it from the sass source and `<link>` it in your head tag.
